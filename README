this plugin apply rules before executing task, like maven enforcer plugin
for now, it is very basic, I only implemented two rules to check jdk and gradle version

how to try this plugin:
1. git clone xxxxx (the git repo of this project)
2. gradle clean install
3. gradle -b example echo

further:
1. if it is the right place to perform the evaluation? (project.afterEvaluate)
2. remove maven enforcer dependencies
3. mutil-projects support
4. user can provide validator class which located in the user's project
